        <p>My name is Abel and I'm six years old and I was the one that wanted to make this website to help Palestine. I'm sad that so many Palestinians have been killed by Israel. So that's why I drew a sad face. I picked out the fonts and the colors for this website. My mom did the coding. The code shows a sad face for everyone Israel has killed in Palestine (this is a UN statistic for people killed since October 7, 2023, most recently updated on March 14, 2024.)</p>
